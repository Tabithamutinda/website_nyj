        <h3>Tabby</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> I am the first-born in a family of 3 children. The fun part is that my two
          siblings are guys,
          which I am entirely grateful for.Being raised with brothers has been the coolest thing ever and as
          of now, I am glad I don't have sisters. I love my brothers.Growing up, I have always been that
          kid who will ask my parents for toy cars when my age mates were playing with dolls.PS, Cars are way
          cooler than playing with a doll.All those experiences, highs and lows,all the laughter and
          tears, I would choose my family over and over again, Because thats what family means.I am self-driven
          and all but I like to lean more on what's best for my family.Being here, I will be able to give them the life
          they desire. I adore my family. I love sarcasm, which has
          gotten me in trouble so many times. Its hard to show my true feelings since people think am not serious most
          of the times. So am secretive.<br><strong>Hobbies.</strong><br>I love reading novels, I have a collection at
          home, my family makes sure
          am sorted in that area. My best collections that they got me sometimes back are;The Percy Jackson and the Gods
          of Olympus(5 books),The Kane Chronicles(3 books) and Magnus Chase and The Gods of Asguard(3 books) All these
          by
          Rick Riordan. There is also Lethal by Sandra Brown.In general books are my comfort zone whenever I want to
          relax.
          <br><strong>Society</strong><br>
          I believe that the society is all good in the theme that it seems to carry that they are there for you. I just
          think that's faulty.
          Because not all these people always want what is good for you.Look at that mother that sits at the road side
          everyday
          begging for food. People just pass and not just because they don't have money to help her out, but because
          some
          say that
          they can't help someone who isn't family or she's pretending while in real sense I feel like they are just
          tryng
          to
          console themselves and help themselves sleep at night because even when it comes to family,they still won't
          help
          willingly. Just a few people contribute to her cup. Others just look at her pitifully. Pity doesn't help
          anyone,
          actions will and prayer. I hope the society changes and we actually embrace the say that <i>Umoja ni
            nguvu,utengano ni udhaifu.</i>
          <br><strong>Women</strong><br>
          Women are the backbone of the society. I am not saying this just because people say so but because I have seen
          it.
          I believe that if women were being paid for every single thing they do, families would be well-off right
          now.Mothers
          wake up early morning to go work themselves tirelessly so that they can feed their kids.They can do anything,
          literally
          anything for their children.Mothers deserve alot better than what they go through.Make your Mummy proud.
          That's
          the least
          you and I can do for our Mummy's while giving them better.

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>I have so many memories with these two chipmunks.They always make my days be more peaceful and focused.
          They are a part of me that can never be filled by anyone else.Riding bicycles and climbing trees has been our
          musketeers goal. I
          remember a time when I carried Matthew on our bicycle which for your information had no breaks at the
          time, downhill. We were screaming at the top of our lungs while racing at speeds that if our parents
          came to know off, we would be stewed alive! I remember pressing my foot on the back tire when I saw
          that there was a car approaching.Long story short, We made it out with no broken bones, at the time.
          When my brother Peter was 8 months old, Matt and I were playing with him on the sofa when he fell
          from the sofa. My mum was out at the time. The only thing that sold us out was there was a spoon on
          the floor when he fell so it made some noise when he fell on it. Wueeeh, you know that time when
          something happens and you look at the scene then back at each other? Haha Matt was the first to
          react. He picked him up before Mum came in. When asked we said that I was the one who fell on the
          spoon since it had clanked hard.
          <br>So far am learning alot of things through my brothers.They taught me that I don't always have
          to be alone and sort everything without help.We sort everything together no matter how hard or easy it is
          that's team work for us.

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>Mummy is a funny person. When its her turn to tell us what she's
          grateful for after supper or when explaining something to us, she gets so in it that she confuses
          kamban words with swahili or english words.Hehehe then she says her famous word 'asi'.Apart from that,
          she gives good surprises even if its not your birthday or a special occassion. Ooooh and she is super
          focused on her work. Like when I accompany her to work in Buruburu, she walks pretty fast and has no
          time to entertain me when I complain she's going fast. She tells me
        <blockquote>"Wenda mbesa no ngiya
          wike wea. Vei cha unoa nundu naasya taku, ndimunenga maisha maseo".</blockquote>I kinda get her point she says that if you want to have money, you must work for it. And
        if she doesn't go fast to work and get her hours in, she won't have money to feed and house us. In
        general.
        <br> Mum never complains that life is so unfair and everything.She is a very strong reigious woman.
        I remember there are times I would wake up in the middle of the night to get water and find her sitted
        in her bed reading a bible since she lacked sleep. Not only does she do this,but also quotes the bible to me
        everyday and whenever I call her, she always has a verse for me, which is daily.In general, If you want to know
        me well,
        just know my love for my family and you are done.
