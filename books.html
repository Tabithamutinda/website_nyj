                <p><strong>THEME:MALE CHAUVINISM,VIOLENCE AND ARCHAIC TRADITIONS.</strong>
                    <br>
                    Some males in the book are portraid as people who crave power especially in their own homes.
                    Mostly its just acting like their say is final and the woman doesn't have a voice except being
                    subservient to the man. When Abel married Patricia, he knew pretty well that she was a free spirit
                    and she wouldn't let traditions control her.As Patricia says,
                <blockquote>"He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage"</blockquote>
                I don't know why Patricia still decided that Abel was the man for her the since she knew the
                consequences.
                The fact that Abel went to the lengths of hitting Patricia goes beyond my understanding.
                Even though Patricia was a spit-fire, he shouldn't have done so.He was the one who was on the wrong.
                One night, he set the house on fire while he was tring to heat food on the stove and fell asleep
                halfway.
                Patricia woke him up, berated him then went to call her mother. He walked into their bedroom and hang up
                the call on her.
                He said,<blockquote>"You don't tell people what's happening in this house".</blockquote>He believed
                because they are married he controlled
                everything she said as was the tradition. So he hit her claiming that she didn't respect him.He hit her
                twice and the society still thought
                that it was ok for a man to hit his wife since even the police man couldn't file a case when she
                reported.
                <br> Another instance is when he took her to his home in Tzaneen.All the women there were traditional,
                even Abel's Mum.Abel expected
                Patricia to play her traditional role but she refused to.She overdid bowing to him sice she would go
                down and cower and stay there for a long time which would get uncomfortable.Abel said that she didn't respect him. He wanted her to follow traditions that no longer
                meant anything to her just because she was his wife.
                These two instances are perfect examples of male chauvinism,violence and archaic traditions.
                In my opinion,when you marry a person, it doesn't mean that you have the upper hand on everything.
                Marriage is more of a partnership than anything and laying your hand on a woman should be punishable by law.
                Apartheid really looked down on women.I believe that once you choose to marry someone, you don't
                try to change them by instilling your traditions on them and expecting them
                to follow that. They had their whole life before you but they don't force them on you. Patricia didn't
                force anything on Abel.Marriage should be harmonical and if it ain't better stay alone. </p>

                <p><strong> THEME OF HUMOR</strong>
                    <br>
                    Humor plays a central part in Trevor Noah's approach on life and suffering.
                    It helps him get out of trouble and also make friends. Like the time when he was walking
                    down the street when a group of Zulu guys walked behind him.They were closing in on him and
                    he could hear them talking to one another in their language how they were going to mug him. Since he
                    couldn't run
                    away,he just turned and said in the same language,
                <blockquote>"Yo,guys,why don't we just mug someone together? I'm ready.Let's do it."</blockquote>The guys
                were shell shocked and laughed it off.
                They didn't mug him.The fact that he used humor to play off being mugged and probably being beaten to
                pulp after,gave him the upper hand against those guys.He also made those guys look at him more as an approachable person and even a friend.
                <br> Another incident is when he was in a catholic school and he was getting a beating from the
                principal and he thought that <i>Man,if only my mom hit me like this,</i> which made him laugh out
                loud.The principal was disturbed and said that if he was laughing when getting beaten then there was
                something wrong with him.This got him out of the spanking.
                In Sandringham,he made friends due to the fact that he was fast and he could get to the tuck shop
                fast,this he started as a business since he was the fastest and some of the fat guys had trouble running, this would get him money.
                Since he couldn't fit,his humor helped him blend in, he floated and popped everywhere. <blockquote> " I would pop around everyone, working,chatting,telling jokes,making deliveries."</blockquote> 
                He also says that,<blockquote>"You don't have to be accepted for everything you are,just the one part of yourself that you're willing 
                    to share. For me it was humor.I learned that even though I didn't belong to one group,I could be a part of any group 
                    that was laughing."</blockquote>
